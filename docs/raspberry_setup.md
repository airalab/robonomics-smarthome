# Raspberry setup

For both methods, the first thing you need to do is setup a Raspberry Pi.

Install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card and run the Imager program. From the menu, select 64-bit Ubuntu Server as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown, and then press `write`.

Open the SD card's storage from your computer and navigate inside the root folder of the card. The name of the folder should be something similar to `system-boot`.

Find the file named `network-config` and open it in a text editor. Copy the below text and paste it into the file:
```
version: 2
ethernets:
  eth0:
    dhcp4: true
    optional: true
wifis:
  wlan0:
    dhcp4: true
    optional: true
    access-points:
      "YOUR_WIFI_NAME":
        password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
```

**Make sure that you input your actual wifi name and your wifi password.** Then you need to save the file, and insert the SD card to the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It must connect to your wi-fi network, now you need to find its address. Firstly find your address in the local network with:
```bash
ip a
```
It must look like `192.168.xx.xx` or `172.xx.xx.xx`.

Then scan the network with your address and zero in the end:

```bash 
$ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.xx.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-26 13:50 CEST
Nmap scan report for _gateway (192.168.43.1)
Host is up (0.015s latency).
MAC Address: 8E:F5:A3:DB:03:27 (Unknown)
Nmap scan report for ubuntu (192.168.43.56)
Host is up (0.049s latency).
MAC Address: DC:A6:32:02:46:50 (Raspberry Pi Trading)
Nmap scan report for LAPTOP-27UBLNO7 (192.168.43.234)
Host is up (0.00057s latency).
MAC Address: 7C:B2:7D:9E:95:DA (Intel Corporate)
Nmap scan report for ed-vm (192.168.43.138)
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.07 seconds
```

In this example we can see that the Raspberry Pi's address is `192.168.43.56`. Now you can connect to it over ssh:
```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56
```
Password is "ubuntu".

## Home Assistant

Now we need to install Home Assistant to the Raspberry Pi. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-core). You need to install `Home Assistant Core`. It's actual version is 2021.11.5 and instruction assumes that we already have installed Python 3.9 or newer.

Update your system and install necessary packages:
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip libffi-dev libssl-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf build-essential libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 tzdata libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Create user `homeassistant` and the directory for homeassistant core:
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo useradd -rm homeassistant
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkdir /srv/homeassistant
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo chown homeassistant:homeassistant /srv/homeassistant
```

Next up is to create and change to a virtual environment for Home Assistant Core. This will be done as the homeassistant account.
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo -u homeassistant -H -s
homeassistant@ubuntu:/home/ubuntu$ cd /srv/homeassistant
homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ python3.9 -m venv .
homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ source bin/activate
```

Then install required Python packages:
```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ python3 -m pip install wheel
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ pip3 install homeassistant==2021.11.5
```

Start Home Assistant Core for the first time. This will complete the installation for you, automatically creating the `.homeassistant `configuration directory in the `/home/homeassistant` directory, and installing any basic dependencies:
```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ hass
```

You can now reach your installation via the web interface on `http://%RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`. 
In this example: `http://192.168.43.56:8123`

Create user and finish setup, then stop Home Assistant with `Ctrl+C`.

After this installation process has been completed, from the`python_scripts` folder import some necessary scripts:

```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ mkdir python_scripts
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ cd python_scripts/
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/send_datalog.py
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/control.py
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/utils.py
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/create_config.py
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/decrypt.py
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/encrypt.py
```

Add mnemonic seed from your user account in `config.config` file:
```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ nano /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts/config.config
```

In this format:
```
[user]
SEED = <your mnemonic or raw seed>
```

## Substrate Interface

To pub data to Robonomics you need to install `substrate-interface` python package (you need to install RUST before) to your raspberry. 

Install RUST:
```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ rustup default nightly
```

And install necessary python packages to the virtual environment:
```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ pip3 install pynacl==1.4.0 packaging pycurl
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ pip3 install substrate-interface==1.1.2 --use-feature=2020-resolver
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ pip3 install python-miio==0.5.8 --use-feature=2020-resolver
```
## Systemd services

Now change user (you can run under any user, which allows you to use sudo):

```bash
(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ exit
```

Create new service for home assistant start: 

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homeassistant.service 
```

Paste the following:

```
[Unit]
Description=Home Assistant
After=network-online.target
[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
WorkingDirectory=/srv/%i/
ExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/hass -c "/home/%i/.homeassistant"
Environment="PATH=/srv/%i/bin"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Do the same for robonomics control service:

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/robonomics-control@homeassistant.service 
```

With:
```
[Unit]
Description=Robonomics Control
After=network-online.target
[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
WorkingDirectory=/srv/%i/
ExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/python3.9 "/srv/%i/python_scripts/control.py"
Environment="PATH=/srv/%i/bin"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And enable both services:
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl enable home-assistant@homeassistant.service
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl enable robonomics-control@homeassistant.service
```

After that you can connect your devices:
- [Connection with zigbee2MQTT](zigbee2MQTT.md)
- [Connection through Xiaomi Gateway](xiaomi_gateway.md)
- [Connect Vacuum Cleaner](vacuum_connect.md)
